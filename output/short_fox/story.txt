Short Fox
A fox spots a bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree.
The grapes seem ready to burst with juice, and the fox's mouth waters as the fox gazes longingly at them.
The bunch hangs from a high branch, and the fox has to jump for it.
The first time the fox jumps the fox misses it by a long way.
So the fox walks off a short distance and takes a running leap at it, only to fall short once more.
Again and again the fox tries, but in vain.
Frustrated, the fox sits down and looks at the grapes in disgust.
"What a fool the fox is," the fox says.
"Here the fox is wearing the fox out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."
And off the fox walks very, very scornfully.
